# PROTAC Modeling by MD based HAPOD scoring-Original Input and Output Data

This repo contains the original input and output files along with scripts pertaining to our publication in [J.Med.Chem.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c02155). They were moved over from https://github.com/JL2021MD/PROTACModeling where they were previously stored. The [PROTACModeling](https://github.com/JL2021MD/PROTACModeling) repo is now concisely for users to quickly start using the HAPOD scoring.
